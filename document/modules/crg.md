# Clock REset Generator
The Clock Reset Generator (CRG) module is responsible for generating and distributing clock and reset signals throughout the SoC. It takes an external reference clock and reset signal as inputs and produces multiple clock domains and corresponding reset signals required by various subsystems within the SoC. The CRG ensures that all components operate synchronously and can be reset appropriately.
