# Input Output Subsystem (IO_SS) Module

## Overview

The IO Subsystem module provides interfaces for low-speed peripherals such as UART and SPI. It also houses system components such as the CLINT, PLIC, and System Control CSR. The module is designed to facilitate communication between the core subsystems and these peripherals, ensuring efficient data transfer and control. The diagram below illustrates the structure of the IO Subsystem module.
