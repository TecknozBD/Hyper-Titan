[x] SoC top-level I/Os defined (clocks, resets, interrupts, debug hooks)
[x] Clock/Reset generator integrated and exercised in simulation
[x] System control implemented (reset controls, basic clock enables)
[ ] Peripheral stubs in place and addressable: UART, SPI, CLINT, PLIC
[ ] I/O subsystem integrated (bus connectivity + address map consistency)
[x] ROM + RAM integrated and accessible
[x] APB bridge integrated (and connected to the peripheral subsystem)
[x] E-core subsystem and P-core subsystem integrated in the top-level
[x] AXI converters and AXI2AXIL bridges integrated where required
